## This is a work in progress; always a work in progress. 

* [] WebGL folder and threejs* files are my first experiments in using WebGL. The experience definitely begs further exploration even if my first results were less than impressive. Simply visiting a handful of WebGL sites live today ignites the fire to explore the technology further. 
* [] This was one of my first preprocessor projects. Since then, SCSS has been replaced by LESS in my workflow. My reason was simply processory overhead, with LESS winning by default of being a command-line only implementation. I'm sure there are lighter weight ways to use SCSS, but I was using Koala at the time. A GUI for a preprocessor is totally overkill, in retrospect. 
* [] This domain and internal site is a playground for new technologies. So most of what you see here is not being used, or not completed, or obviously out of place. I will push updates periodically which may fix some of those issues.
